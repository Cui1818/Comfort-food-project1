Presentation Template 

Your presentations are a reflection of the work that you have done as a team. We should have a clear understanding of what the application does, why it was built, and how it was built before we ever experienced your application demo.

Your presentation should translate easily to your informative README. 

Presentation 
1.	Description of what it does w/ Visual Support: Gif / Image of your app doing it.
2.	Motivation for building this w/ Research you did: Into existing apps how is this different how is this the same?
3.	How did you build it out? w/ Infographic of your work-flow
4.	User Stories => Features => task => Branches => Git Commits
5.	User Stories w/ Gif of your application UI completing that user story
6.	Planning Wireframe w/ Side by Side of initial Wireframe vs. end product
7.	Task Assignment => Who did what?
8.	Team work-flow => Working Agreements Stand-ups Playbacks
9.	API Research….

Teamwork & Expectations

Team Effort
Before anything, remember that Projects are a group effort: Working closely with your teammates is a requirement. This both helps teach real-world collaborative workflows, and enables you to tackle more difficult problems than you'd be able to working alone.
In other words, working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage of it!
Note: 
●	100% participation and attendance is required in order to receive credit for the Group Project work. 
●	Participation in all 3 Projects are course requirements.  

How will you be using Git?

Git Commit #
-As a team, we started with git/Vscode interface and commit to Github, after 2 days we realised that it is easy to make mistakes if you do not know the commands. We switched over to using the Github desktop and work started flowing well. 
- stuck time 30mins sometimes, or more but github desktop simplified it for us.

Stuck time ( How long until you consult a teammate?):
●	30 min? 
●	1 hour?

EXAMPLE: 

During Sprint Do The Following:

●	Team members attend daily stand ups @ 6:30pm (T,TH) 10am (sat)
●	We will be expected to be working on Sun and M,W,F (is this true?)
●	Should a team member have a conflict, s/he/they updates the slack team channel in advance of the meeting
●	We believe in in the value of planning collectively as a team
●	Every Team Member is engaged and involved.
●	Every Team Member is committed to the value of the application over individual recognition.
●	Every Team Member will practice active listening.
●	Every Team Member will be directly engaged with the work - not answer texts or phone calls, social media, or other off-topic material (with the exception of emergencies -which will be communicated to the team)


Your Team Working Agreements
During Sprint Do The Following:





Agile Stand-Ups:
For software teams, the stand-up is like the team’s huddle. It’s even commonly known as the daily scrum, and reinforces “we” to keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress.

A stand-up is a daily meeting that involves the core team. 
This meeting’s flavor is unique to each team, but commonly we use three simple questions to generate structure: 
1.	What did I work on yesterday? 
2.	What am I working on today? 
3.	What issues are blocking me? 

These questions highlight progress and help flag team blockers. Also, it strengthens the team when everyone shares the progress they’re contributing to the team. The daily reinforcement of sharing individual successes and plans keeps everyone excited about the team’s overall progress. 

Agile Playbacks:
Teams sometimes have a weekly/bi-weekly meeting called a "playback". This meeting allows team members to explain and demo completed features and the work they did during this past sprint. (normally a work week). Playbacks are important to keep project managers up to date, as well other team members to what has been accomplished during a sprint.
The playback format:
○	Tell your team what you worked on and how it went.
○	Show the progress you have made on your work.
○	Demo any finished work/features.
We encourage you to set up time for playbacks at the end of each sprint.

Project Title: 	The Comfort Food Concept 

 Logo Image: Comfort food
 
Project Description
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This helps provide direction and prevent scope creep.

Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:
●	Problem / Motivation
●	How it addresses the problem
●	Possible source for such data
Summary
Dark kitchen and food deliveries have seen massive growth since 2020 because of the Covid19 pandemic. We have designed Comfort Food App to contribute to existing ways different people such as busy professionals, weight-conscious working class individuals and food lovers can work out a good meal at lunchtime, yet carry on with their daily tasks. The goal of Comfort Food is to unite and simplify the three steps of preparing delicious home-cooked meals: plan, shop and cook, into one intuitive process. This provides an atmosphere to encourage, inspire and elevate the next-gen home cooks.

Problem to solve. 
•	People prefer to pick fresh produce from brick-and-mortar stores to ensure their quality.
•	Due to the large quantity and variety of items, online grocery shopping can be repetitive and tedious compared to other online shopping experiences.
•	Meal plan services help reduce waste and save shopping time but have limited options and are less affordable.
•	High delivery cost is a major barrier to shopping groceries online.
•	Home cooking is cost-effective and is more appealing to health-conscious people. The challenge is that it is time-consuming, and people need better incentives than hunger to step into the kitchen.

Our initial assumptions 
The following assumptions on how the app could potentially help with the problems observed or experienced in home cooking and grocery shopping are:
•	Most people read ratings and reviews before making a purchase decision.
-Incentives are needed to encourage people to give feedback.
•	Online shoppers like the option of free shipping above a certain cost.
-If people plan out the number of groceries needed for the next several meals, they can save on delivery and reduce food waste at the same time.
Research: 
The biggest barriers to online grocery shopping are the cost of items/delivery, and the time it takes for groceries to be delivered, therefore People prefer to buy snacks than any other food (International Food Information Council, 2018)

User preferences
•	It is faster than self-service in-store.
•	It is easy to navigate the products categorized by type.
•	Product information is easily identified in a set format.
•	Shopping online is much faster.
What users do not like
•	The built-in search function is difficult to use without a spelling check.
•	The search bar only shows results for specific keywords, not similar or alternative suggestions.
•	The process of adding an item to the trolley is hard to follow for beginners.
•	Purchasing ingredients from different stores in one order is difficult.
•	Pricing strategies were found to be free download to attract users; Upgrade to unlock more features for power user; however, how to determine the free and paid features is a challenge to fulfil various user needs.
•	How to encourage purchase when the minimum expense for free shipping is not met.
Our Goals and Motivation 
Goals

•	Get inspiration for cooking.
•	Know the number of servings from a recipe.
•	Get cooking tips.

•	Find recipes for specific ingredients.
•	Find recipes for a certain type of dishes.
•	A good place to post and share recipes.
•	Have a place to keep all the shopping lists.
•	Buy quality groceries online from trusted stores.

Team working tools	We utilised all available collaborative software we know 	n/a	Microsoft teams (meeting), Trello, figma, the scrum approach, GitHub, Slack	Seek out more ways of doing things especially using new technologies
Problems everyone encountered was shared	communication	Committing to Github	Due to branch formation- we deleted folder after day 2 and started all over	Tiffany gave us a recorded video
-We found use of desktop GitHub most effective
Technical Knowledge sharing 	Shared similar issues on APIs.
Not being expert in it	APIs	More communication and use of tutorials, video clips 	More lesson on use of APIs
